# FinanceTools

## The goal of this project is to serve as a set of tools with which to perform financial analysis

That being said, it's a hobby project. And while I feel confident in me python skills, I am still very new to finance/stocks.

As such, please use any tools you find in here at your own risk.


## Contents

- nasdaq_data_prep.ipynb: A notebook which extracts some nasdaq tickers and some other relevant info from an online source.

- symbol_analysis.ipynb: A notebook which does some basic exploration and manipulation of historical stock data from yahoo finance.

- ml_test.ipynb: A first attempt at creating a stock price prediction machine learning model. (Created with the help of GPT-4, as I don't have much experience in machine learning)

- transformer.ipynb: A second attempt at creating a stock price prediction machine learning model, this time using the transformer architecure.


## Note

This repo is a work in progress, and some of the notebooks as very messy. Perhaps in the future I will do some cleaning, perhaps not.
